# Pycharm configurations

## Configure PyCharm to Use VirtualBox for Execution

A good video on configuring [Remote Interpreters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlgQBB1UDU&ab_channel=PyCharmbyJetBrains)

SSH Access must be enabled on VirtualBox.

See [VIRTUALBOX.md: Enable VirtualBox SSH](./VIRTUALBOX.md#enable-virtualbox-ssh)

On the VirtualBox, create a location where project files are to be uploaded:
```shell
mkdir ~/python-runtime
```

On the Host Machine, Create a new PyCharm project:
Select the project location, then under Python Interpreter select Previously Configured Interpreter:
Click on `Add Interpreter`, and select `On SSH...`

Note: You only need to create one SSH connection per VirtualBox SSH config (server/port/user), and it can be reused across projects 

Host: `127.0.0.1`
Port: `2222`
Username: `<username>`

Password: `******`
Select `Save Password`

Next page validates connection

Select Virtual Environment on the left panel
Select `New` for Environment
Specify the location: `/home/<username>/<projectname>_env`
Specify the base interpreter (System python selected by default): `/usr/bin/python3`
Click on `Create` to create remote interpreter

Finish Creating the project.

On opening of project, I get a popup telling me project is out of sync, and do I want to auto-sync - select auto-sync

Select Menu `Tools > Deployment > Configuration`

Select the Mapping Tab
Local Path should be your project files
Deployment Path is where you want local files to be uploaded to VirtualBox
Deployment Path: `/home/<username>/python-runtime`
Click OK to save and close

Select Menu `Tools > Deployment > Automatic Upload`

Try running a file.

If it fails with File not found, 

Select Menu `Tools > Deployment > Upload to <username>@127.0.0.1:2222`

Confirm and run again.

Modify the file and run again - changes should be automatically updated
